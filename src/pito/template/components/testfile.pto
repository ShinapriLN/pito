This is content from \textbf{components/testfile.pto}.

It demonstrates that {{include("components/nested_example.pto")}} works correctly
and can also contain LaTeX markup like this:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

You can also call functions here:
{{getSomething()}}
{{getSomethingButWithArgs("from testfile.pto")}}
